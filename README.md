# Vocal Assistant - Gergana

The vocal assistant is a project created in Dec 2020 by myself. It is made with Python.
It's name is Gergana and you can give it vocal orders to ask it the following action:

- Greetings
- Date/Hour
- Google search
- Wikipedia search
- Reminder
- Take a screenshot
- Ask about battery %
- Restart your PC
- Send email
- Play songs (playlist)

The script for the Vocal Assistant is done.
I am now in the process of building a desktop app to put the Vocal Assistant in it.

&#x1F539; Thinking about Qt Creator for now.
